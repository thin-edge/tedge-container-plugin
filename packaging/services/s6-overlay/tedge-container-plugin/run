# tedge-container-plugin generally requires root access to be able to interact
# with the container engine socket, therefore it will try to run as root
# if sudo is available, otherwise it will run as the user defined in the Dockerfile
# "USER <name>" directive.
#
# Since the service can be running as root, it will require stopping the service
# using a root user, therefore a trap is used to specifically listen to the SIGTERM
# signal and pass it down to the service by using sudo (if present) to ensure the
# kill command is allowed to operate on the service.
